          We use both all and every to describe a total number of something.
          Every describes each member of a complete group. All describes a
          complete group.

          <li>The food was sent to every student.</li>

        <p>
          In some situations we use <b>all </b>on its own. We can also use
          everyone/everybody/everything.

          We use <b>every </b> with singular entitites and <b>all</b> with
          uncountable and plural nouns

          We use both all and every to describe a total number of something.
          Every describes each member of a complete group. All describes a
          complete group.

        <ul className="page-examples">

          <li>The food was sent to every student.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In some situations we use <b>all </b>on its own. We can also use
          everyone/everybody/everything.
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>
            The bingo event is at Camden Yards. It starts at 4 and all are
            welcome.

            welcome.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We can use every to focus on each individual member.</p>
        <p>Compare:</p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>
            All attendees need to silence their phones. (describes the entire

            individuals )
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We use <b>every </b> with singular entitites and <b>all</b> with
          uncountable and plural nouns
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">

          <h1>Talk versus Speak</h1>
        </div>
        <p className={styles.grammar_explanation_paragraph}>
          The verbs talk and speak both have the meaning â€˜say wordsâ€™, but they
          are used differently depending on context. For example speak is more
          formal than talk. Talk, on the other hand focuses on a speaker and at
          least one listener, and can mean 'have a conversation'
        </p>
        <p>
          We use talk for more informal situations and speak for more formal
          situations:
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>
            Dante will talk to the group about the benefits of meditation.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>The president will speak shortly to her advisors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We normally use <b>to</b> after talk and speak. We can also use{" "}
          <b>with</b>:
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>Could I talk to you for a moment?</li>
          <li>The director needs to speak to you.</li>
          <li>She spoke with the general for an hour. </li>
          <li>I talked with her about it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When we refer to languages, we use speak:</p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>I don't speak Swahili, but I want to learn.</li>
          <li>How many languages does Ahmad speak?</li>
        </ul>

        <p className={styles.grammar_explanation_paragraph}>
          Some phrasal verbs require either talk and speak. Talk and speak in
          these contexts are not interchangeable.
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>
            His students talk back to him, because he accepts it. (talk back
            means to be disrespectful)
          </li>

          <li>
            My hearing is terrible. I always need to ask people to speak up.
            (speak up means to speak louder)
          </li>
          <li>
            I know we are fighting a lot now, but I want to talk it out (talk it
            out means to resolve problems by talking calmly)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Talk can be a noun or a verb. Speak is always only a verb. </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>He gave a great talk about diet.</li>
        </ul>

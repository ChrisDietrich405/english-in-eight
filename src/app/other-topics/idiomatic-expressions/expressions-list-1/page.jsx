            better to do things as quickly as possible

              Example: Come on hurry up! <b>Time is money.</b>

            <b>Foolproof</b> - incapable of going wrong or being misused
            <br />
            <p>

              am even I'm able to use it.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>

            </p>
          </li>

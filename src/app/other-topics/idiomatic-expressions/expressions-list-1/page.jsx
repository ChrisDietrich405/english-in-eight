              <b>Time is money</b> - time is a valuable resource, therefore it
              is better to do things as quickly as possible
              <br />
              <Typography>
                Example: Come on hurry up! <b>Time is money.</b>

              <b>Foolproof</b> - incapable of going wrong or being misused
              <br />
              <Typography>
                Example: I have a <b>foolproof</b> security system. As dumb as I
                am even I'm able to use it.

              unexpectedly
              <br />
              <Typography>
                Example: The car came <b>out of nowhere</b> and hit our van.

              outperforming, outclassing, etc., someone
              <br />
              <Typography>
                Example: I hate telling stories around Marcus because he always
                tries <b>to one up</b> you with some amazing story of his own.

              careful now so that problems do not occur later on
              <br />
              <Typography>
                Example: It's probably not necessary to check the numbers again,

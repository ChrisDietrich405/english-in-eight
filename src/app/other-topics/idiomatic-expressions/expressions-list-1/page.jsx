        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Time is money</b> - time is a valuable resource, therefore it is
            better to do things as quickly as possible
            <br />
            <p>
              Example: Come on hurry up! <b>Time is money.</b>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Foolproof</b> - incapable of going wrong or being misused
            <br />
            <p>
              Example: I have a <b>foolproof</b> security system. As dumb as I
              am even I'm able to use it.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Out of nowhere</b> - appearing or happening suddenly and
            unexpectedly
            <br />
            <p>
              Example: The car came <b>out of nowhere</b> and hit our van.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>To one up someone</b> - to make a point of outdoing,
            outperforming, outclassing, etc., someone
            <br />
            <p>
              Example: I hate telling stories around Marcus because he always
              tries <b>to one up</b> you with some amazing story of his own.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>It's better to be safe than sorry</b> - itâ€™s better to be careful
            now so that problems do not occur later on
            <br />
            <p>
              Example: It's probably not necessary to check the numbers again,
              but <b>it's better to be safe than sorry.</b>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

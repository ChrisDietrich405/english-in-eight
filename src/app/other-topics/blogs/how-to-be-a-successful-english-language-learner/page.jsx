        Learning a second language is a very challenging task and so I would
        like to share with you some ideas on how you can do it the most
        efficient way possible.
      </Typography>

      <Typography component="h5" mt={2} mb={0.5}>
        <b>Keep it fun and engaging</b>
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Watch funny movies, read interesting books, find an exchange partner. If
        we are bored we don't learn. So let's do the opposite. If you absolutely
        love cooking, look for cooking channels in English. Also, keep it short.
        If you are looking for some grammar, find short videos. They may not
        give every detail, but you also won't start getting distracted after 10
        minutes. Another suggestion is to find an exchange partner, someone who
        can share an hour a week with. For example if you are a Portuguese
        speaker you find someone to teach Portuguese and they can teach you
        English. There are groups on Facebook that offer exchanges for
        English.&nbsp;

          Here's an example
        </a>
      </Typography>
      <Typography component="h5" mt={2} mb={0.5}>
        <b>Don't be shy</b>
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Being shy and afraid to make mistakes is your worst enemy. There are
        many extremely smart people who will never learn a second language
        because of their pride. People don't like to feel stupid. When you learn
        a second language you have to accept the fact that sometimes you are
        going to feel insecure and nervous. If you want to be successful you
        have to accept the fact that you will make mistakes. It's ok. It's the
        only way you improve. And it won't matter how much you study with a
        website or a book, if you don't experiment with the language you won't
        improve.
      </Typography>
      <Typography component="h5" mt={2} mb={0.5}>
        <b>Teach what you learn </b>
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Every time and I repeat every time you do a lesson, you need to teach
        someone what you learned. The best way to learn is to teach. If you
        don't know someone who is learning English, talk to a family member.
        They love you so they will give you ten minutes. They won't understand,
        but that doesn't matter. What matters is that you explained the
        information.
      </Typography>
      <Typography component="h5" mt={2} mb={0.5}>
        <b>Focus on examples, not confusing explanations</b>
      </Typography>
      <Typography mb={1}>
        Many times grammar explanations are confusing and frustrating. Don't
        focus too much on them. Focus on examples. I guarantee after reading
        some examples, explanations will make more sense (be easier to
        understand).
      </Typography>
      <Stack>
        <Image
          style={{
            margin: "0 auto",
            objectFit: "contain",
            width: "100%",
            height: "auto",
          }}
          height={350}
          width={550}

      <Typography component="h5" mt={2} mb={0.5}>
        <b>Find time</b>
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        You're busy right? Of course! Find moments when you can review. In the
        bathroom while brushing your teeth you can explain to yourself a few
        phrasal verbs you learned from the website. At the supermarket waiting
        in line (waiting to buy the food), get the English notes that you put in
        your jacket.
      </Typography>
      <Typography component="h5" mt={2} mb={0.5}>
        <b>Personal connection</b>
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        When you are learning English connect the material to YOUR family, job,
        hobbies (the things you like to do). For example while studying the verb
        "to be" in the present tense, you would say "my wife <b>is</b> smart"
        and my children <b>are</b> energetic. When you think about your wife and
        children in this context the learning is more real and you will remember
        more.
      </Typography>
      <Typography component="h5" mt={2} mb={0.5}>
        <b>Repeat and repeat again</b>
      </Typography>
      <Typography mb={2}>
        Repeat and repeat. Athletes build muscle memory in order to be more
        successful. It means they make the same motion throwing a ball again and
        again, maybe 50-100 times a day! Your brain is a muscle. Learning
        another language isn't easy. It's hard work, but if you repeat the
        exercises again and again you will feel and be more successful.

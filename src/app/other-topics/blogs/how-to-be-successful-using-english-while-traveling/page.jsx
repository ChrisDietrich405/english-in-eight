        English is spoken by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, making it
        the most widely spoken languages on the planet. Whether you find
        yourself in remote areas or cosmopolitan cities, the chances are high
        that someone will understand and respond to English. Speaking English
        gives you some independence in virtually any location. Obviously you can
        use a translator on your phone while communicating, but to have a more
        complete experience you should study at least some simple greetings,
        questions, etc....

        English, making it easier for travelers to find their way, purchase
        tickets, and get essential information about schedules and routes.

        more confident when you use transportation.

        market, asking for recommendations at a local restaurant, or
        participating in community events, being able to communicate in English
        opens up doors to a deeper understanding of the culture you're
        exploring. While interacting don't be shy. The majority of people will
        love to help you and will be patient. If you need someone to repeat

I built this website for my English students. I saw that a lot of English grammar websites had an outdated ui or was too dense. I used NextJS, Material UI and EmailJS. I also added Docker.

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)  
[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
[EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/)
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

I built this website for my English students. I saw that a lot of English grammar websites either had outdated UIs or were too dense. My solution was to create an extremely easy user experience that is light and attractive. I used NextJS, Material UI and EmailJS. I also added Docker.

  - [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
  - [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/)
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

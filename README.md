I built this website for my English students. I saw that a lot of English grammar websites either had outdated uis or were too dense. My solution was to create an extremely easy user experience that is light and attractive. I used NextJS, Material UI and EmailJS. I also added Docker.

    - [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/)

- **Backend:**
    - Node.js
    - TypeScript
    - Express.js
    - Database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
    - Unit Testing (jest, mocha, etc.)
